Arduino Nano has a ATMEGA328P with the following memory:

 * 32K bytes of in-system self-programmable flash program memory
 * 1Kbytes EEPROM
 * 2Kbytes internal SRAM

Using the FlashForth command `.free` as defined in free.fs in the Flashforth repo, after
loading all the Drag race code. 

    Flash:16208 bytes
    Eeprom:980 bytes
    Ram:1084 bytes 

400 bytes are defined in the 'my-array' used for debugging data.

After empty:

    Flash:23932 bytes
    Eeprom:1012 bytes
    Ram:1564

After just hw_base.fth is loaded:

    Flash:20778 bytes
    Eeprom:1012 bytes
    Ram:1536 bytes 

After drag_race.fth is loaded:

    Flash:16220 bytes
    Eeprom:980 bytes
    Ram:1084 bytes
